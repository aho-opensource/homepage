# TODO

* Fix the lightbox on front page. Maybe use something else? See [Slideshow](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) and [Modal Images](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modal_images.asp) and [Responsive Image Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_grid_responsive.asp).
* Create pages for each program (architecture, design, landscap architecture)
* Create good guides for students:
    - How to create a nice looking and easy portfolio using github/github pages.
    - How to use markdown and pandoc for writing.
    - How to use Github for your studies. Git, Gists and more. Collaboration.
* Create pandoc/latex template for diploma writing
* Create a curated list of good learning resources for courses at AHO, preferably 
  Wikipedia and similar open sources. Maybe use our own github wiki for that?
