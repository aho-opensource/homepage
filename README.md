## TODO
* create good guides for students:
  - how to create a nice looking and easy portfolio using github/github pages 
  * how to use markdown and pandoc for writing
  * how to use Github for your studies. Git, Gists and more. Collaboration.
* create pandoc/latex template for diploma writing
* create a curated list of good learning resources for courses at AHO, preferably 
  Wikipedia and similar open sources. Maybe use our own github wiki for that?
